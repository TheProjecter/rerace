Rerace is a racing game with a twist. It combines a 2-dimensional racing game and a 3-dimensional flying and fighting game. Gameplay happens in two different stages. The game begins with you racing a car along a track against other opponents. At the end of the race you are transported back in time to the beginning of the race. However now you are controlling a flying fighter ship called a “Guardian”. The goal of this stage is to sabotage the opponent racers from the past in order to ensure that your past self wins the race. You are also responsible for defending your past self from the other Guardians who have traveled back in time. If at any point your racer is obstructed, a warning will come up and you will be required to switch back to controlling your racer  to avoid the obstacles and return back to your past path. Once leaving your old path you will be required to return before you can switch back to the fighter. The first past player to cross the finish line wins the game
